# myESPEEPROM
Wrappers for EEPROM Library

This handles EEPROM reads, writes, updates they way I like to do it.

Implements very simple checksum creation and checking.

Currently only handles bytes (uint8_t).

I've tried to make the comments totally self-explanatory.

See my MQTTmonitor code for a use case.
